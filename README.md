# Person Name Recognition

Built an LSTM Recurrent Neural Network that determines whether given string is the name of a
person or not. Data obtained by extracting ontologies from dataset http://wiki.dbpedia.org/downloads-2016-10#p10608-2

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and 
testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
tensorflow or tensorflow-gpu, Keras, numpy
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
pip install tensorflow-gpu
pip isntall keras
```

## Running the tests

To try this system open `demo.ipynb` read through the notebook and follow the instructions in side.

### Open demo.ipynb 

```
jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
```


## Built With

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - The backend framework used
* [Keras](https://keras.io/) - API Used to wrap Tensorflow
